The trie has a find and add function that works faster than a binaray search tree. 
It has a worst case O(n) with the n being the search string size.
While Binaray Search has a worst case of log(n).
The trie can easily relpace hashing, as it puts everything in Alphabetical order.
While the Trie should be faster, it needs the most memory for each node used.
It'll have a node for evey letter in the Alhpabet. While bst has only a left and right child.
